### Problem
A serial transmission line can transmit 960 characters a second. Write a program that will calculate how long
it will take to send a file, given the file size. Test your program on a 400MB (419,430,400 byte) file which may
take days.

### Problem analysis
**Input** - File size <br>
**Output** - Time it takes to transfer the a file with the given file size <br>
**Process** - <br>
Accepting input file size <br>
Calculating time it takes to send file in seconds as file size / 960 <br>
calculating time it takes to send file in days, hours and minutes <br>
