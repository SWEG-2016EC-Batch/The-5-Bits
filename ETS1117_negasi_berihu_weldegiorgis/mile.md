
#    Problem Statement: 
Write a program to calculate the total number of miles an automobile can drive without refueling, given the fuel tank's capacity (in gallons) and the miles the automobile can drive per gallon.
#  A) Problem Analysis:

### 1. Inputs:

 - Accept the Number of miles the automobile can be drived per gallon(miles_per_gallons).
 - Accept Capacity of the fuel tank in gallons of the automobile(cap_in_gallons).
### 2. Output:
- Display the Total miles the automobile can drive without refueling (tot_number_miles).
### 3. Process:

 - Input the cap_in_gallons and miles_per_gallons.
 - Calculate the total miles using the formula: 
          tot_number_miles = miles_per_gallons*cap_in_gallons .
 - Output the calculated total miles.
### B)  pseudocode
1. Start
2. Prompt the user to enter `miles_per_gallons` and read it .
4. Prompt the user to enter the `capacity of the fuel tank in gallons` and read it.
6. Compute `tot_number_miles =  miles_per_gallons*cap_in_gallons `
7. Display: "The number of miles the automobile can be driven without refueling is: `tot_number_miles`
8. Stop
