# BMI Calculator Algorithm

## Problem:
The task is to calculate BMI for a person based on their weight and height.

## Steps:
1. Ask the user for weight (kg) and height (m).
2. Use the formula `BMI = weight / (height * height)` to calculate BMI.
3. Check the BMI value:
   - If BMI < 18.5: Underweight
   - If 18.5 ≤ BMI ≤ 24.9: Normal weight
   - If BMI ≥ 25: Overweight
4. Ask the user if they want to calculate for another person.
5. Stop the program if the user says "no."
